INTRODUCTION
The urSign client stuff.

RUNNING
The main entry-point to the app is in App.java.

This is a Maven project, a module which comes through Eclipse by default.
Maven is used to manage the following dependencies currently:
* Apache HTTP Client

See pom.xml for details.

TODO
* Contents of LoginForm needs to be transferred into LoginDialog.
  JDialog has been used due to its modality, so App.main() won't
  continue unless we have passed the LoginDialog somehow.
* Server comms needs to be added to login functions, and cookie
  tracking to ensure that no server-side data is compromised.
* Tests for user (failing tests, a la Agile/TDD) need to be made
  by testing team. Also add dummy methods for collections/user
  for testing purposes. AllTests suite should be used + JUnit.
* Comment User code.
  
CHANGELOG
* See the git commit log for information on individual contributions.
